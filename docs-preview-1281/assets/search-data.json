[{"id":"1","title":"Release 0.3","content":"Release 0.3 {#sec-release-0-3} Release 0.3 had to come out before I wanted it to due to Neovim 0.9 dropping into nixpkgs-unstable. The Treesitter changes have prompted a Treesitter rework, which was followed by reworking the languages system. Most of the changes to those are downstreamed from the original repository. The feature requests that was originally planned for 0.3 have been moved to 0.4, which should come out soon. Changelog {#sec-release-0-3-changelog} We have transitioned to flake-parts, from flake-utils to extend the flexibility of this flake. This means the flake structure is different than usual, but the functionality remains the same. We now provide a home-manager module. Do note that it is still far from perfect, but it works. is now bundled with if the user has enabled Copilot assistant. which-key section titles have been fixed.

v0.7 we are removing in favor of making the top-level DAG, and thereby making the entire configuration Lua based. This change introduces a few breaking changes: has been removed, which means that you have to convert all of your custom vimscript-based configuration to Lua. As for how to do that, you will have to consult the Neovim documentation and your search engine. After migrating your Vimscript-based configuration to Lua, you might not be able to use the same entry names in , because those have also slightly changed. See the new DAG entries in nvf manual for more details. Why? Neovim being an aggressive refactor of Vim, is designed to be mainly Lua based; making good use of its extensive Lua API. Additionally, Vimscript is slow and brings unnecessary performance overhead while working with different configuration formats. rewrite {#sec-vim-maps-rewrite} Instead of specifying map modes using submodules (e.g., ), a new submodule with support for a option has been introduced. It can be either a string, or a list of strings, where a string represents the short-name of the map mode(s), that the mapping should be set for. See for more information. For example: has to be replaced by removed in favor of {#sec-nvim-code-action-menu-deprecation} The nvim-code-action-menu plugin has been archived and broken for a long time, so it's being replaced with a young, but better alternative called fastaction.nvim. Simply remove everything set under , and set to . Note that we are looking to add more alternatives in the future like dressing.nvim and actions-preview.nvim, in case fastaction doesn't work for everyone. based modules removed {#sec-type-based-modules-removed} As part of the autocompletion rewrite, modules that used to use a option have been replaced by per-plugin modules instead. Since both modules only had one type, you can simply change -> -> removed in favor of {#sec-nixpkgs-fmt-deprecation} has been archived for a while, and it's finally being removed in favor of nixfmt (more information can be found here .

As of the 0.4 release, keybinds will no longer be hardcoded and instead provided by each module's own keybinds section. The old keybind system ( ) is now considered deprecated and the new lib functions are recommended to be used for adding keybinds for new plugins, or adding keybinds to existing plugins.

We would like for any contributor to be able to propagate their changes, or add new features to the project with minimum possible friction. As such, below are the guides and guidelines written to streamline the contribution process and to ensure that your valuable input integrates into nvf's development as seamlessly as possible without leaving any question marks in your head. This section is directed mainly towards those who wish to contribute code into the project. If you instead wish to report a bug, or discuss a potential new feature implementation (which you do not wish to implement yourself) first look among the already open issues and if no matching issue exists you may open a new issue and describe your problem/request. While creating an issue, please try to include as much information as you can, ideally also include relevant context in which an issue occurs or a feature should be implemented. If you wish to make a contribution, but feel stuck - please do not be afraid to submit a pull request, we will help you get it in. Getting Started {#sec-contrib-getting-started} You, naturally, would like to start by forking the repository to get started. If you are new to Git and GitHub, do have a look at GitHub's Fork a repo guide for instructions on how you can do this. Once you have a fork of nvf , you should create a separate branch based on the most recent branch. Give your branch a reasonably descriptive name (e.g. or ) and you are ready to work on your changes Implement your changes and commit them to the newly created branch and when you are happy with the result, and positive that it fulfills our Contributing Guidelines , push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request . The default pull request template available on the nvf repository will guide you through the rest of the process, and we'll gently nudge you in the correct direction if there are any mistakes. Guidelines {#sec-guidelines} If your contribution tightly follows the guidelines, then there is a good chance it will be merged without too much trouble. Some of the guidelines will be strictly enforced, others will remain as gentle nudges towards the correct direction. As we have no automated system enforcing those guidelines, please try to double check your changes before making your pull request in order to avoid \"faulty\" code slipping by. If you are uncertain how these rules affect the change you would like to make then feel free to start a discussion in the discussions tab ideally (but not necessarily) before you start developing. Adding Documentation {#sec-guidelines-documentation} Almost all changes warrant updates to the documentation: at the very least, you must update the changelog. Both the manual and module options use Nixpkgs Flavoured Markdown . The HTML version of this manual containing both the module option descriptions and the documentation of nvf (such as this page) can be generated and opened by typing the following in a shell within a clone of the nvf Git repository: Formatting Code {#sec-guidelines-formatting} Make sure your code is formatted as described in code-style section . To maintain consistency throughout the project you are encouraged to browse through existing code and adopt its style also in new code. Formatting Commits {#sec-guidelines-commit-message-style} Similar to code style guidelines we encourage a consistent commit message format as described in commit style guidelines . Commit Style {#sec-guidelines-commit-style} The commits in your pull request should be reasonably self-contained. Which means each and every commit in a pull request should make sense both on its own and in general context. That is, a second commit should not resolve an issue that is introduced in an earlier commit. In particular, you will be asked to amend any commit that introduces syntax errors or similar problems even if they are fixed in a later commit. The commit messages should follow the seven rules , except for \"Capitalize the subject line\". We also ask you to include the affected code component or module in the first line. A commit message ideally, but not necessarily, follow the given template from home-manager's own documentation where refers to the code component (or module) your change affects, is a very brief description of your change, and is an optional clarifying description. As a rare exception, if there is no clear component, or your change affects many components, then the part is optional. See example commit message for a commit message that fulfills these requirements. Example Commit {#sec-guidelines-ex-commit-message} The commit 69f8e47e9e74c8d3d060ca22e18246b7f7d988ef in home-manager contains the following commit message. Similarly, if you are contributing to nvf , you would include the scope of the commit followed by the description: Long description can be omitted if the change is too simple to warrant it. A minor fix in spelling or a formatting change does not warrant long description, however, a module addition or removal does as you would like to provide the relevant context, i.e. the reasoning behind it, for your commit. Finally, when adding a new module, say , we use the fixed commit format . You can, of course, still include a long description if you wish. In case of nested modules, i.e you are recommended to contain the parent as well - for example . Code Style {#sec-guidelines-code-style} Treewide {#sec-code-style-treewide} Keep lines at a reasonable width, ideally 80 characters or less. This also applies to string literals and module descriptions and documentation. Nix {#sec-code-style-nix} nvf is formatted by the alejandra tool and the formatting is checked in the pull request and push workflows. Run the command inside the project repository before submitting your pull request. While Alejandra is mostly opinionated on how code looks after formatting, certain changes are done at the user's discretion based on how the original code was structured. Please use one line code for attribute sets that contain only one subset. For example: If you move a line down after the merge operator, Alejandra will automatically unfold the whole merged attrset for you, which we do not want. For lists, it is mostly up to your own discretion how you want to format them, but please try to unfold lists if they contain multiple items and especially if they are to include comments. Testing Changes {#sec-testing-changes} Once you have made your changes, you will need to test them thoroughly. If it is a module, add your module option to (located in the root of this project) inside . Enable it, and then run the maximal configuration with to check for build errors. If neovim opens in the current directory without any error messages (you can check the output of inside neovim to see if there are any errors), then your changes are good to go. Open your pull request, and it will be reviewed as soon as possible. If it is not a new module, but a change to an existing one, then make sure the module you have changed is enabled in the maximal configuration by editing , and then run it with . Same procedure as adding a new module will apply here. Keybinds {#sec-keybinds} As of 0.4, there exists an API for writing your own keybinds and a couple of useful utility functions are available in the extended standard library . The following section contains a general overview to how you may utilize said functions. Custom Key Mappings Support for a Plugin {#sec-custom-key-mappings} To set a mapping, you should define it in . An example, simple keybinding, can look like this: There are many settings available in the options. Please refer to the documentation to see a list of them. nvf provides a helper function, so that you don't have to write the mapping attribute sets every time: , which mimics neovim's function You can read the source code of some modules to see them in action, but the usage should look something like this: [!NOTE] If you have come across a plugin that has an API that doesn't seem to easily allow custom keybindings, don't be scared to implement a draft PR. We'll help you get it done. Adding Plugins {#sec-additional-plugins} There are two methods for adding new Neovim plugins to nvf . npins is the faster option that should be preferred if the plugin consists of pure Lua or Vimscript code. In which case there is no building required, and we can easily handle the copying of plugin files. Alternative method, which is required when plugins try to build their own libraries (e.g., in Rust or C) that need to be built with Nix to function correctly. With npins {#sec-npins-for-plugins} npins is the standard method of adding new plugins to nvf . You simply need the repository URL for the plugin, and can add it as a source to be built automatically with one command. To add a new Neovim plugin, use . For example: Then run: ::: {.note} Be sure to replace any non-alphanumeric characters with for . For example ::: Once the command is done, you can start referencing the plugin as a string . Packaging Complex Plugins {#sec-pkgs-for-plugins} Some plugins require additional packages to be built and substituted to function correctly. For example blink.cmp requires its own fuzzy matcher library, built with Rust, to be installed or else defaults to a much slower Lua implementation. In the Blink documentation, you are advised to build with but that is not ideal since we are leveraging the power of Nix. In this case the ideal solution is to write a derivation for the plugin. We use to build the library from the repository root, and copy everything in the phase. In a similar fashion, you may utilize and other Nixpkgs builders to build your library from source, and copy the relevant files and Lua plugin files in the phase. Do note, however, that you still need to fetch the plugin sources somehow. npins is, once again, the recommended option to fetch the plugin sources. Refer to the previous section on how to use npins to add a new plugin. Plugins built from source must go into the overlay. It will automatically create flake outputs for individual packages. Lastly, you must add your package to the plugin builder ( ) function manually in . Once done, you may refer to your plugin as a string . Modular setup options {#sec-modular-setup-options} Most plugins is initialized with a call to . We use a special function that lets you easily add support for such setup options in a modular way: . Once you have added the source of the plugin as shown above, you can define the setup options like this: This above config will result in this Lua script: Now users can set any of the pre-defined option field, and can also add their own fields! Details of toLuaObject {#sec-details-of-toluaobject} As you've seen above, is used to convert our nix attrSet , into a lua table. Here are some rules of the conversion: Nix converts to lua Number and strings convert to their lua counterparts Nix attribute sets ( ) and lists ( ) convert into Lua dictionaries and tables respectively. Here is an example of Nix -> Lua conversion. -> -> You can write raw Lua code using . This function is part of nixpkgs, and is accessible without relying on nvf 's extended library. will yield the following result: The above expression will be interpreted as a Lua expression in the final config. Without the function, you will only receive a string literal. You can use it to feed plugin configuration tables Lua functions that return specific values as expected by the plugins. Lazy plugins {#sec-lazy-plugins} If the plugin can be lazy-loaded, should be used to add it. Lazy plugins are managed by .

Plugins From Different Sources","content":"Adding Plugins From Different Sources {#sec-plugin-sources} nvf attempts to avoid depending on Nixpkgs for Neovim plugins. For the most part, this is accomplished by defining each plugin's source and building them from source. To define plugin sources, we use npins and pin each plugin source using builtin fetchers. You are not bound by this restriction. In your own configuration, any kind of fetcher or plugin source is fine. Nixpkgs & Friends {#ch-plugins-from-nixpkgs} and options take either a string , in which case a plugin from nvf's internal plugins registry will be used, or a package .

In such a case you might want to configure your Neovim instance using Lua, and nothing but Lua. It is also possible to mix Lua and Nix configurations. Pure Lua or hybrid Lua/Nix configurations can be achieved in two different ways. Purely , by modifying Neovim's runtime directory or impurely by placing Lua configuration in a directory found in . For your convenience, this section will document both methods as they can be used. Pure Runtime Directory {#sec-pure-nvf-runtime} As of 0.6, nvf allows you to modify Neovim's runtime path to suit your needs. One of the ways the new runtime option is to add a configuration located relative to your , which must be version controlled in pure flakes manner. This will add the directory, or rather, the store path that will be realised after your flake gets copied to the Nix store, to Neovim's runtime directory.

Impure Absolute Directory {#sec-impure-absolute-dir} As of Neovim 0.9 , {var} is a variable expected by Neovim to decide on the configuration directory. nvf sets this variable as , meaning will be regarded as the configuration directory by Neovim, similar to how behaves in regular installations.

Boasting flexibility, robustness and ease of use, this projecct allows you to configure a fully featured Neovim instance with a few lines of Nix with lots of options for advanced users as well. Try it out {#ch-try-it-out} Thanks to the portability of Nix, you can try out nvf without actually installing it to your machine. Below are the commands you may run to try out different configurations provided by this flake. As of v0.5, two specialized configurations are provided: Nix ( ) - Nix language server + simple utility plugins Maximal ( ) - Variable language servers + utility and decorative plugins You may try out any of the provided configurations using the command on a system where Nix is installed. Do keep in mind that this is susceptible to garbage collection meaning that the built outputs will be removed from your Nix store once you garbage collect. Using Prebuilt Configs {#sec-using-prebuilt-configs} Available Configurations {#sec-available-configs} [!NOTE] The below configurations are provided for demonstration purposes, and are not designed to be installed as is. You may refer to the installation steps below and the helpful tips section for details on creating your own configurations. Nix {#sec-configs-nix} configuration by default provides LSP/diagnostic support for Nix alongside a set of visual and functional plugins. By running , which is the default package, you will build Neovim with this config. This command will start Neovim with some opinionated plugin configurations, and is designed specifically for Nix. the configuration lets you see how a fully configured Neovim setup might look like without downloading too many packages or shell utilities. Maximal {#sec-configs-maximal} is the ultimate configuration that will enable support for more commonly used language as well as additional complementary plugins. Keep in mind, however, that this will pull a lot of dependencies. It uses the same configuration template with the Nix configuration, but supports many more languages, and enables more utility, companion or fun plugins. [!WARNING] Running the maximal config will download a lot of packages as it is downloading language servers, formatters, and more. If CPU time and bandwidth are concerns, please use the default package instead. Installing nvf {#ch-installation} There are multiple ways of installing nvf on your system.
