We would like for any contributor to be able to propagate their changes, or add new features to the project with minimum possible friction. As such, below are the guides and guidelines written to streamline the contribution process and to ensure that your valuable input integrates into nvf's development as seamlessly as possible without leaving any question marks in your head.\nThis section is directed mainly towards those who wish to contribute code into the project. If you instead wish to report a bug, or discuss a potential new feature implementation (which you do not wish to implement yourself) first look among the already open issues and if no matching issue exists you may open a new issue and describe your problem/request.\nWhile creating an issue, please try to include as much information as you can, ideally also include relevant context in which an issue occurs or a feature should be implemented. If you wish to make a contribution, but feel stuck - please do not be afraid to submit a pull request, we will help you get it in.\nGetting Started\nTo contribute to nvf, you'll first want to fork the repository. If you are new to Git and GitHub, do have a look at GitHub's Fork a repo guide for instructions on how you can do this. Once your fork is created, you should create a separate branch based on the most recent main branch. While you can work on the main branch of your repository, it is generally preferable to use feature branches. You should give your branch a reasonably descriptive name (e.g. feature/new-debugger or fix/pesky-bug) and you are ready to work on your changes!\nImplement your changes and commit them to the newly created branch and when you are happy with the result, and positive that it fulfills our Contributing Guidelines, push the branch to GitHub and Create a Pull Request The default pull request template available on the nvf repository will guide you through the rest of the process, and we'll gently nudge you in the correct direction if there are any mistakes.\nBefore submitting your pull request, please ensure that:\nThe code is formatted as described in the formatting section\nThe commit message fits the contributing guidelines (nvf does not use Conventional Commits!)\nYou have updated the changelog entry and optionally updated the documentation with important information\n\nNone of those are reasons for a Pull Request to be closed, but it will reduce the number of \"roundtrips\", or rather, the back-and-forth required before we can merge your Pull Request.\n[!IMPORTANT] If you do not agree with the idea of using Microsoft GitHub for contributions, that is perfectly understandable. Unless you refuse to have your code hosted on this platform, you may submit patches through e-mail.\nYou may send your patches to @NotAShelf using the public e-mail located on the GitHub page. Though, please remember to adhere to the contributing guidelines strictly, as e-mail introduces a significant overhead to the communication process.\nGuidelines\nIf your contribution tightly follows the guidelines, then there is a good chance it will be merged without too much trouble. Some of the guidelines will be strictly enforced, others will remain as gentle nudges towards the correct direction. As we have no automated system enforcing those guidelines, please try to double check your changes before making your pull request in order to avoid \"faulty\" code slipping by.\nIf you are not quite certain how those rules affect the change you are planning to make, then please start a friendly discussion in the discussions tab before you begin developing. This is not a requirement, but it might answer some of your burning questions and make the contribution process easier for all parties.\nFormatting\nThere are various files within the nvf repository. To maintain a sense of consistency and to avoid clashing opinions on how formatters should behave, we are very opinionated on how those files should be formatted.\nNix files must be formatted with the Alejandra formatter, following some specific tips found in Nix style section.\nMarkdown files must be formatted with the deno fmt command, as described in the Markdown style section.\n\nMake sure your code is formatted as described in code style section before your changes are submitted.\nFormatting Commits\nSimilar to code style guidelines we encourage a consistent commit message format as described in commit style guidelines.\nCommit Style\nThe commits in your pull request should be reasonably self-contained. Which means each and every commit in a pull request should make sense both on its own and in general context. That is, a second commit should not resolve an issue that is introduced in an earlier commit. In particular, you will be asked to amend any commit that introduces syntax errors or similar problems even if they are fixed in a later commit.\nThe commit messages should follow the seven rules, except for \"Capitalize the subject line\". We also ask you to include the affected code component or module in the first line. A commit message ideally, but not necessarily, follow the given template from home-manager's own documentation\nwhere {component} refers to the code component (or module) your change affects, {description} is a very brief description of your change, and {long description} is an optional clarifying description.\nAs a rare exception, if there is no clear component, or your change affects many components, then the {component} part is optional. See example commit message for a commit message that fulfills these requirements.\nExample Commit\nThe sample commit from Home Manager contains the following commit message.\nSimilarly, if you are contributing to nvf, you would include the scope of the commit followed by the description:\nLong description can be omitted if the change is too simple to warrant it. A minor fix in spelling or a formatting change does not warrant long description, however, a module addition or removal does as you would like to provide the relevant context, i.e., the reasoning for your commit.\nFor new plugin additions, the following is a good starting point:\nYou can, of course, still include a long description if you wish.\nIn case of nested modules, e.g., modules/languages/java.nix you are recommended to contain the parent as well -- for example languages/java: some major change , or if it's a new language module, languages/java: init\nCode Style\nTreewide\nAcross the tree, you're encouraged to follow kebab-case for file names, and keep text files (such as Markdown) to 80 characters or less. This 80 character recommendation also applies to option descriptions and string literals inside of Nix files.\nMarkdown\nVarious Markdown files are used for documentation in the nvf repository. Besides the README, the manual is written almost entirely in Markdown. Since nvf uses a special variant of CommonMark, dubbed \"Nixpkgs-flavored CommonMark\" within this repository, you are encouraged to use the deno fmt command (provided by pkgs.deno) to format your Markdown sources. To avoid accidentally formatting HTML or CSS files, you might want to specify the file extension as follows:\nYou may also pass --check to the deno fmt command above to see if your formatting complies with the project standards.\nNix\nnvf is formatted by the alejandra tool and the formatting is checked in the pull request and push workflows. Run the nix fmt command inside the project repository before submitting your pull request.\nWhile Alejandra is mostly opinionated on how code looks after formatting, certain changes are done at the user's discretion based on how the original code was structured.\nAttribute Sets\nPlease use one line code for attribute sets that contain only one subset. For example:\nIf you move a line down after the merge operator, Alejandra will automatically unfold the whole merged attribute set for you, which we do not want.\nThough, if the right-hand side is more than a single line, it is okay to move to a new line. For example:\nLists\nFor lists, it is mostly up to your own discretion how you want to format them, but please try to unfold lists if they contain multiple items and especially if they are to include comments.\nTesting Changes\nOnce you have made your changes, you will need to test them thoroughly. To make testing easier you may either use the configuration.nix located in the repository root, or use the development package located in flake/develop.nix. The development package allows you to quickly bootstrap a Neovim configuration with only the required modules, instead of the packages that consume the configuration.nix, so it is generally preferable. To use it navigate to the develop.nix module, and update the configuration set with the Neovim configuration that you would like to test with. For example:\nYou may then run this package with nix run .#develop and check for build or runtime errors. If Neovim builds and opens without any errors, then your changes are good to go. Open your pull request, and it will be reviewed as soon as possible.\nIf your changes are rather large, or if you would like to instead test with a more complex configuration then you might use the configuration.nix for testing. Make your changes, and then build either the default or maximal package to test your changes.\n[!IMPORTANT] configuration.nix is a module used to bootstrap demo packages and should generally not be changed unless migrating old APIs or updating the set of default plugins. Similarly, the develop.nix file is for reference, and testing configurations should not be committed.\nAdding Documentation\nAlmost all changes to nvf's codebase warrant updates to the documentation. At the very least, you must update the relevant changelog document to describe your changes. The documentation files found within the repository use a superset of Nixpkgs Flavoured Markdown thanks to our in-house documentation generator.\nAs a general rule of thumb:\nEverything in the CommonMark spec is supported\nEverything in Nixpkgs Flavoured Markdown is supported\nGithub Flavored Markdown is supported for Tables and Admonitions\n\nBy feeding NDG, our documentation generator, Markdown sources we can generate a HTML manual with various goodies, including a search page and an options page. The latter, found under options.html contains module options, similar to the official Nixpkgs search utility. The supported syntax for NDG can be found over at the library documentation.\nBuilding the Documentation\nThe HTML version of this documentation, dubbed the \"nvf manual\", can be generated and opened by typing the following in a shell within a clone of the nvf Git repository:\nAdditionally, if you are adding new links to the documentation it is generally recommended that you run the package that identifies dead URLs in the documentation:\nYou must ensure that the HTML Documentation builds before submitting a pull request. If the documentation builds, an automatic \"preview\" build will be deployed automatically for your Pull Request. You may use this preview to view your changes as your Pull Request is updated.\nFormatting Changelog Entries\nFor additions, removals or any general change that concerns the users you must add a changelog entry. The changelog entries are later included in the rendered manual for users hoping to learn what has changed.\nTo maintain consistency, you must follow the following format in the changelog:\nIf this is your first contribution, you should add yourself to the changelog. Linking your GitHub account is not a strict requirement; it can be any page that people can use to discover you. Below the link to your profile, you should include a brief description of your changes. Those descriptions must be in past tense, unlike commit messages.\nWhile adding a new section, please insert the section at an arbitrary location under the ## Changelog section rather than the end of the document. This helps avoid merge conflicts.\nBreaking Changes\nIf you are introducing breaking changes to the repository, then you must also briefly mention what has changed in the breaking changes section of the changelog document that you are editing. If this section does not yet exist, you must create it.\nThis section is critical, as it is used to communicate to the users what has changed in the codebase and what breakage they may expect upon an update. To be comprehensive, you should include migration steps or how users may mitigate breakage depending on the context of the change.\nAdding Plugins\nnvf generally tries to avoid using Neovim plugins from Nixpkgs, and thus uses one of the two alternative methods where applicable. npins is the faster option that should be preferred if the plugin consists of pure Lua or Vimscript code. In which case there is no building required, and we can easily handle the copying of plugin files. Alternative method, which is required when plugins try to build their own libraries (e.g., in Rust, C or even Assembly) that need to be built with Nix to function correctly. In this case you must use a local overlay.\nWith npins\nnpins is the standard, and as described above, the faster method of adding new plugins to nvf. You simply need the repository URL for the plugin, and you can add it as a source to be built automatically with just one command. To add a new Neovim plugin, use npins. For example:\nThen run:\n[!NOTE] Be sure to replace any non-alphanumeric characters with - for --name. For example\nOnce the npins command is done, you can start referencing the plugin as a string.\nPackaging Complex Plugins\nSome plugins require additional packages to be built and substituted to function correctly. For example blink.cmp requires its own fuzzy matcher library, built with Rust, to be installed or else defaults to a much slower Lua implementation. In the Blink documentation, you are advised to build with cargo but that is not ideal since we are leveraging the power of Nix. In this case the ideal solution is to write a derivation for the plugin.\nWe use buildRustPackage to build the library from the repository root, and copy everything in the postInstall phase.\nIn a similar fashion, you may utilize stdenv.mkDerivation and other Nixpkgs builders to build your library from source, and copy the relevant files and Lua plugin files in the postInstall phase. Do note, however, that you still need to fetch the plugin sources somehow. npins is, once again, the recommended option to fetch the plugin sources. Refer to the previous section on how to use npins to add a new plugin.\nPlugins built from source must go into the flake/pkgs/by-name overlay. It will automatically create flake outputs for individual packages. Lastly, you must add your package to the plugin builder (pluginBuilders) function manually in modules/wrapper/build/config.nix. Once done, you may refer to your plugin as a string.\nModular Setup Options\nMost plugins is initialized with a call to require('plugin').setup({...}).\nWe use a special function that lets you easily add support for such setup options in a modular way: mkPluginSetupOption.\nOnce you have added the source of the plugin as shown above, you can define the setup options like this:\nThis above config will result in this Lua script:\nNow users can set any of the pre-defined option field, and can also add their own fields!\nDetails of toLuaObject\nAs you've seen above, toLuaObject is used to convert our nix attrSet cfg.setupOpts, into a lua table. Here are some rules of the conversion:\nNix null converts to lua nil\nNumber and strings convert to their lua counterparts\nNix attribute sets ({}) and lists ([]) convert into Lua dictionaries and tables respectively. Here is an example of Nix -> Lua conversion.\n{foo = \"bar\"} -> {[\"foo\"] = \"bar\"}\n[\"foo\" \"bar\"] -> {\"foo\", \"bar\"}\n\nYou can write raw Lua code using lib.generators.mkLuaInline. This function is part of nixpkgs, and is accessible without relying on nvf's extended library.\nmkLuaInline \"function add(a, b) return a + b end\" will yield the following result:\n\nThe above expression will be interpreted as a Lua expression in the final config. Without the mkLuaInline function, you will only receive a string literal. You can use it to feed plugin configuration tables Lua functions that return specific values as expected by the plugins.\n\nLazy Loading Plugins\nIf the plugin can be lazy-loaded, vim.lazy.plugins should be used to add it. Lazy plugins are managed by lz.n.\nThis results in the following lua code:\nA full list of options can be found in the vim.lazy.plugins spec on the rendered manual.\nKeybinds\nAs of 0.4, there exists an API for writing your own keybinds and a couple of useful utility functions are available in the extended standard library. The following section contains a general overview to how you may utilize said functions.\nCustom Key Mappings Support for a Plugin\nTo set a mapping, you should define it in vim.keymaps. As an example, a simple keybinding can look like this:\nThere are many other settings available in the keymap module. Please refer to the module option documentation for a full and up-to-date list of them.\nTo make adding new keymaps for your favorite plugins easier, nvf provides a helper function. This is so that you do not have to write the mapping attribute sets every time:\nmkKeymap, which mimics Neovim's vim.keymap.set function\n\nYou can read the source code of some modules to see them in action, but the usage should look something like this:\n[!TIP] If you have come across a plugin that has an API that doesn't seem to easily allow custom keybindings, don't be scared to implement a draft PR. We'll help you get it

v0.9\nPreface\nWhat is nvf\nnvf is a highly modular, configurable, extensible and easy to use Neovim configuration framework built for and designed to be used with Nix. Boasting flexibility, robustness and ease of use (among other positive traits), this project allows you to configure a fully featured Neovim instance with a few lines of Nix while leaving all kinds of doors open for integrating Lua in your configurations whether you are a beginner or an advanced user.\nTry it Out\nThanks to the portability of Nix, you can try out nvf without actually installing it to your machine. Below are the commands you may run to try out different configurations provided by this flake. As of v0.5, two specialized configurations are provided:\nNix (packages.nix) - Nix language server + simple utility plugins\nMaximal (packages.maximal) - Variable language servers + utility and decorative plugins\n\nYou may try out any of the provided configurations using the nix run command on a system where Nix is installed.\nDo keep in mind that this is susceptible to garbage collection meaning that the built outputs will be removed from your Nix store once you garbage collect.\nUsing Prebuilt Configurations\nAvailable Configurations\n[!NOTE] The below configurations are provided for demonstration purposes, and are not designed to be installed as is. You may refer to the installation steps below and the helpful tips section for details on creating your own configurations.\nNix\nNix configuration by default provides LSP/diagnostic support for Nix alongside a set of visual and functional plugins. By running nix run .#, which is the default package, you will build Neovim with this config.\nThis command will start Neovim with some opinionated plugin configurations, and is designed specifically for Nix. The nix configuration lets you see how a fully configured Neovim setup might look like without downloading too many packages or shell utilities.\nMaximal\nMaximal is the ultimate configuration that will enable support for more commonly used language as well as additional complementary plugins.
