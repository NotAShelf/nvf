0.7","content":"Release 0.7 {#sec-release-0-7} Release notes for release 0.7 Breaking Changes and Migration Guide {#sec-breaking-changes-and-migration-guide-0-7} removed {#sec-vim-configrc-removed} In v0.7 we are removing in favor of making the top-level DAG, and thereby making the entire configuration Lua based. This change introduces a few breaking changes: has been removed, which means that you have to convert all of your custom vimscript-based configuration to Lua. As for how to do that, you will have to consult the Neovim documentation and your search engine. After migrating your Vimscript-based configuration to Lua, you might not be able to use the same entry names in , because those have also slightly changed. See the new DAG entries in nvf manual for more details. Why? Neovim being an aggressive refactor of Vim, is designed to be mainly Lua based; making good use of its extensive Lua API. Additionally, Vimscript is slow and brings unnecessary performance overhead while working with different configuration formats. rewrite {#sec-vim-maps-rewrite} Instead of specifying map modes using submodules (e.g., ), a new submodule with support for a option has been introduced. It can be either a string, or a list of strings, where a string represents the short-name of the map mode(s), that the mapping should be set for. See for more information. For example: has to be replaced by removed in favor of {#sec-nvim-code-action-menu-deprecation} The nvim-code-action-menu plugin has been archived and broken for a long time, so it's being replaced with a young, but better alternative called fastaction.nvim. Simply remove everything set under , and set to . Note that we are looking to add more alternatives in the future like dressing.nvim and actions-preview.nvim, in case fastaction doesn't work for everyone. based modules removed {#sec-type-based-modules-removed} As part of the autocompletion rewrite, modules that used to use a option have been replaced by per-plugin modules instead. Since both modules only had one type, you can simply change -> -> removed in favor of {#sec-nixpkgs-fmt-deprecation} has been archived for a while, and it's finally being removed in favor of nixfmt (more information can be found here . To migrate to , simply change to . leader changes {#sec-leader-changes} This has been deprecated in favor of using the more generic (you can use to change this instead). Rust specific keymaps now use instead of by default. This is to avoid conflicts with other modules. You can change with , but it's recommended to set it to something other than to avoid conflicts. changes {#sec-vim-opt-changes} Inline with the leader changes , we have removed some options that were under as convenient shorthands for options. ::: {.warning} As v0.7 features the addition of {option} , those options are now considered as deprecated. You should migrate to the appropriate options in the submodule. ::: The changes are, in no particular order: , , , , , , , , and have been mapped to their {option} equivalents. Please see the module definition for the updated options. has been removed as it lead to confusing behaviour. You can replicate the same functionality by setting , and under as you see fit. Changelog {#sec-release-0-7-changelog} ItsSorae : Add support for typst under This will enable the language server, and the formatter frothymarrow : Modified type for {option} from to a for better type checking. Fix null generating an error and not being filtered out. Add basic transparency support for theme by setting the highlight group for , , , and optionally to . Fix {option} using the wrong type instead of the expected type . horriblename : Fix broken treesitter-context keybinds in visual mode Deprecate use of to define empty tables in Lua. Empty attrset are no longer filtered and thus should be used instead. Add dap-go for better dap configurations Make noice.nvim customizable Standardize border style options and add custom borders Remove in wrapper options. As nvf uses as of recent changes, we can safely assume any configuration in is intentional. Switch from rust-tools.nvim to the more feature-packed rustaceanvim . This switch entails a whole bunch of new features and options, so you are recommended to go through rustacean.nvim's README to take a closer look at its features and usage Add lz.n support and lazy-load some builtin plugins. Add simpler helper functions for making keymaps poz : Add ocaml-lsp support Fix \"Emac\" typo Add new-file-template.nvim to automatically fill new file contents using templates Make neo-tree.nvim display file icons properly by enabling diniamo : Move the dag entry to before .

Migrate bufferline to setupOpts for more customizability Use as the default language server for C languages Expose , which for example allows the user to create abstractions for adding plugins Migrate indent-blankline to setupOpts for more customizability. While the plugin's options can now be found under , the previous iteration of the module also included out of place/broken options, which have been removed for the time being. These are: - this was already unused - this had nothing to do with the plugin, please configure it yourself by adding to your lua configuration - this also had nothing to do with the plugin, please configure it yourself by adding to your lua configuration Replace with , see the breaking changes section above for more details Add a option to nvim-surround, which allows modifying options that aren't defined in nvf.

Add sorting function options for completion sources under {option} Add C# support under , with support for both omnisharp-roslyn and csharp-language-server. Add Julia support under . Note that the entirety of Julia is bundled with nvf, if you enable the module, since there is no way to provide only the LSP server. Add support for running code using cached commands. Make Neovim's configuration file entirely Lua based. This comes with a few breaking changes: has been removed. You will need to migrate your entries to Neovim-compliant Lua code, and add them to instead. Existing vimscript configurations may be preserved in functions. Please see Neovim documentation on is now the top-level DAG, and the internal has been introduced for setting up internal plugins. See the \"DAG entries in nvf\" manual page for more information. Rewrite , see the breaking changes section above. NotAShelf : Add as the default Markdown formatter. This will be enabled automatically if you have autoformatting enabled, but can be disabled manually if you choose to. Add for optionally sourcing additional lua files in your configuration.

0.4","content":"Release 0.4 {#sec-release-0-4} Following the release of v0.3, I have decided to release v0.4 with a massive new change: customizable keybinds. As of the 0.4 release, keybinds will no longer be hardcoded and instead provided by each module's own keybinds section. The old keybind system ( ) is now considered deprecated and the new lib functions are recommended to be used for adding keybinds for new plugins, or adding keybinds to existing plugins. Alongside customizable keybinds, there are a few quality of life updates, such as integration and the new experimental Lua loader of Neovim 0.9 thanks to our awesome contributors who made this update possible during my absence.

This is a pattern expected to be followed by all contributors in the future. Added for image previews. The final neovim package is now exposed. This means you can build the neovim package that will be added to your package list without rebuilding your system to test if your configuration yields a broken package. Changed the tree structure to distinguish between core options and plugin options. Added plugin auto-discovery from plugin inputs. This is mostly from JordanIsaac's neovim-flake .

Added {option} and {option} for inserting verbatim Lua configuration before and after the resolved Lua DAG respectively. Both of those options take strings as the type, so you may read the contents of a Lua file from a given path. Added and for ignoring certain filetypes in spellchecking and enabling respectively. The previously used aliases to the latter option. Exposed , , , and from the function under their respective options.

This type is most used for topologically sorting strings. The DAG type allows the attribute set entries to express dependency relations among themselves. This can, for example, be used to control the order of configuration sections in your . The below section, mostly taken from the home-manager manual explains in more detail the overall usage logic of the DAG type. entryAnywhere {#sec-types-dag-entryAnywhere} Indicates that can be placed anywhere within the DAG. This is also the default for plain attribute set entries, that is and are equivalent. entryAfter {#ch-types-dag-entryAfter} Indicates that must be placed after each of the attribute names in the given list.

We would like for any contributor to be able to propagate their changes, or add new features to the project with minimum possible friction. As such, below are the guides and guidelines written to streamline the contribution process and to ensure that your valuable input integrates into nvf 's development as seamlessly as possible without leaving any question marks in your head. This section is directed mainly towards those who wish to contribute code into the project. If you instead wish to report a bug, or discuss a potential new feature implementation (which you do not wish to implement yourself) first look among the already open issues and if no matching issue exists you may open a new issue and describe your problem/request. While creating an issue, please try to include as much information as you can, ideally also include relevant context in which an issue occurs or a feature should be implemented. If you wish to make a contribution, but feel stuck - please do not be afraid to submit a pull request, we will help you get it in. Getting Started {#sec-contrib-getting-started} To contribute to nvf , you'll first want to fork the repository. If you are new to Git and GitHub, do have a look at GitHub's Fork a repo guide for instructions on how you can do this. Once your fork is created, you should create a separate branch based on the most recent branch. While you can work on the main branch of your repository, it is generally preferable to use feature branches. You should give your branch a reasonably descriptive name (e.g. or ) and you are ready to work on your changes! Implement your changes and commit them to the newly created branch and when you are happy with the result, and positive that it fulfills our Contributing Guidelines , push the branch to GitHub and Create a Pull Request The default pull request template available on the nvf repository will guide you through the rest of the process, and we'll gently nudge you in the correct direction if there are any mistakes. Before submitting your pull request, please ensure that: The code is formatted as described in the formatting section The commit message fits the contributing guidelines ( nvf does not use Conventional Commits!) You have updated the changelog entry and optionally updated the documentation with important information None of those are reasons for a Pull Request to be closed, but it will reduce the number of \"roundtrips\", or rather, the back-and-forth required before we can merge your Pull Request. [!IMPORTANT] If you do not agree with the idea of using Microsoft GitHub for contributions, that is perfectly understandable. Unless you refuse to have your code hosted on this platform, you may submit patches through e-mail. You may send your patches to @NotAShelf using the public e-mail located on the GitHub page. Though, please remember to adhere to the contributing guidelines strictly, as e-mail introduces a significant overhead to the communication process. Guidelines {#sec-guidelines} If your contribution tightly follows the guidelines, then there is a good chance it will be merged without too much trouble. Some of the guidelines will be strictly enforced, others will remain as gentle nudges towards the correct direction. As we have no automated system enforcing those guidelines, please try to double check your changes before making your pull request in order to avoid \"faulty\" code slipping by. If you are not quite certain how those rules affect the change you are planning to make, then please start a friendly discussion in the discussions tab before you begin developing. This is not a requirement, but it might answer some of your burning questions and make the contribution process easier for all parties. Formatting {#sec-guidelines-formatting} There are various files within the nvf repository. To maintain a sense of consistency and to avoid clashing opinions on how formatters should behave, we are very opinionated on how those files should be formatted. Nix files must be formatted with the Alejandra formatter, following some specific tips found in Nix style section . Markdown files must be formatted with the command, as described in the Markdown style section . Make sure your code is formatted as described in code style section before your changes are submitted. Formatting Commits {#sec-guidelines-commit-message-style} Similar to code style guidelines we encourage a consistent commit message format as described in commit style guidelines . Commit Style {#sec-guidelines-commit-style} The commits in your pull request should be reasonably self-contained. Which means each and every commit in a pull request should make sense both on its own and in general context. That is, a second commit should not resolve an issue that is introduced in an earlier commit. In particular, you will be asked to amend any commit that introduces syntax errors or similar problems even if they are fixed in a later commit. The commit messages should follow the seven rules , except for \"Capitalize the subject line\". We also ask you to include the affected code component or module in the first line. A commit message ideally, but not necessarily, follow the given template from home-manager's own documentation where refers to the code component (or module) your change affects, is a very brief description of your change, and is an optional clarifying description. As a rare exception, if there is no clear component, or your change affects many components, then the part is optional. See example commit message for a commit message that fulfills these requirements. Example Commit {#sec-guidelines-ex-commit-message} The sample commit from Home Manager contains the following commit message. Similarly, if you are contributing to nvf , you would include the scope of the commit followed by the description: Long description can be omitted if the change is too simple to warrant it. A minor fix in spelling or a formatting change does not warrant long description, however, a module addition or removal does as you would like to provide the relevant context, i.e., the reasoning for your commit. For new plugin additions, the following is a good starting point: You can, of course, still include a long description if you wish. In case of nested modules, e.g., you are recommended to contain the parent as well -- for example , or if it's a new language module, Code Style {#sec-guidelines-code-style} Treewide {#sec-code-style-treewide} Across the tree, you're encouraged to follow kebab-case for file names, and keep text files (such as Markdown) to 80 characters or less. This 80 character recommendation also applies to option descriptions and string literals inside of Nix files. Markdown {#sec-code-style-markdown} Various Markdown files are used for documentation in the nvf repository. Besides the README, the manual is written almost entirely in Markdown. Since nvf uses a special variant of CommonMark, dubbed \"Nixpkgs-flavored CommonMark\" within this repository, you are encouraged to use the command (provided by ) to format your Markdown sources. To avoid accidentally formatting HTML or CSS files, you might want to specify the file extension as follows: You may also pass to the command above to see if your formatting complies with the project standards. Nix {#sec-code-style-nix} nvf is formatted by the alejandra tool and the formatting is checked in the pull request and push workflows. Run the command inside the project repository before submitting your pull request. While Alejandra is mostly opinionated on how code looks after formatting, certain changes are done at the user's discretion based on how the original code was structured. Attribute Sets Please use one line code for attribute sets that contain only one subset. For example: If you move a line down after the merge operator, Alejandra will automatically unfold the whole merged attribute set for you, which we do not want. Though, if the right-hand side is more than a single line, it is okay to move to a new line. For example: Lists For lists, it is mostly up to your own discretion how you want to format them, but please try to unfold lists if they contain multiple items and especially if they are to include comments. Testing Changes {#sec-testing-changes} Once you have made your changes, you will need to test them thoroughly. To make testing easier you may either use the located in the repository root, or use the development package located in . The development package allows you to quickly bootstrap a Neovim configuration with only the required modules, instead of the packages that consume the , so it is generally preferable. To use it navigate to the module, and update the set with the Neovim configuration that you would like to test with. For example: You may then run this package with and check for build or runtime errors. If Neovim builds and opens without any errors, then your changes are good to go. Open your pull request, and it will be reviewed as soon as possible. If your changes are rather large, or if you would like to instead test with a more complex configuration then you might use the for testing. Make your changes, and then build either the default or package to test your changes. [!IMPORTANT] is a module used to bootstrap demo packages and should generally not be changed unless migrating old APIs or updating the set of default plugins. Similarly, the file is for reference, and testing configurations should not be committed . Adding Documentation {#sec-guidelines-documentation} Almost all changes to nvf 's codebase warrant updates to the documentation. At the very least, you must update the relevant changelog document to describe your changes. The documentation files found within the repository use a superset of Nixpkgs Flavoured Markdown thanks to our in-house documentation generator . As a general rule of thumb: Everything in the CommonMark spec is supported Everything in Nixpkgs Flavoured Markdown is supported Github Flavored Markdown is supported for Tables and Admonitions By feeding NDG, our documentation generator, Markdown sources we can generate a HTML manual with various goodies, including a search page and an options page . The latter, found under contains module options, similar to the official Nixpkgs search utility. The supported syntax for NDG can be found over at the library documentation . Building the Documentation The HTML version of this documentation, dubbed the \"nvf manual\", can be generated and opened by typing the following in a shell within a clone of the nvf Git repository: Additionally, if you are adding new links to the documentation it is generally recommended that you run the package that identifies dead URLs in the documentation: You must ensure that the HTML Documentation builds before submitting a pull request. If the documentation builds, an automatic \"preview\" build will be deployed automatically for your Pull Request. You may use this preview to view your changes as your Pull Request is updated. Formatting Changelog Entries For additions, removals or any general change that concerns the users you must add a changelog entry. The changelog entries are later included in the rendered manual for users hoping to learn what has changed. To maintain consistency, you must follow the following format in the changelog: If this is your first contribution, you should add yourself to the changelog. Linking your GitHub account is not a strict requirement; it can be any page that people can use to discover you. Below the link to your profile, you should include a brief description of your changes. Those descriptions must be in past tense, unlike commit messages. While adding a new section, please insert the section at an arbitrary location under the section rather than the end of the document. This helps avoid merge conflicts. Breaking Changes If you are introducing breaking changes to the repository, then you must also briefly mention what has changed in the breaking changes section of the changelog document that you are editing. If this section does not yet exist, you must create it. This section is critical , as it is used to communicate to the users what has changed in the codebase and what breakage they may expect upon an update. To be comprehensive, you should include migration steps or how users may mitigate breakage depending on the context of the change. Adding Plugins {#sec-additional-plugins} nvf generally tries to avoid using Neovim plugins from Nixpkgs, and thus uses one of the two alternative methods where applicable. npins is the faster option that should be preferred if the plugin consists of pure Lua or Vimscript code. In which case there is no building required, and we can easily handle the copying of plugin files. Alternative method, which is required when plugins try to build their own libraries (e.g., in Rust, C or even Assembly) that need to be built with Nix to function correctly. In this case you must use a local overlay. With npins {#sec-npins-for-plugins} npins is the standard, and as described above, the faster method of adding new plugins to nvf . You simply need the repository URL for the plugin, and you can add it as a source to be built automatically with just one command. To add a new Neovim plugin, use . For example: Then run: [!NOTE] Be sure to replace any non-alphanumeric characters with for . For example Once the command is done, you can start referencing the plugin as a string . Packaging Complex Plugins {#sec-pkgs-for-plugins} Some plugins require additional packages to be built and substituted to function correctly. For example blink.cmp requires its own fuzzy matcher library, built with Rust, to be installed or else defaults to a much slower Lua implementation. In the Blink documentation, you are advised to build with but that is not ideal since we are leveraging the power of Nix. In this case the ideal solution is to write a derivation for the plugin. We use to build the library from the repository root, and copy everything in the phase. In a similar fashion, you may utilize and other Nixpkgs builders to build your library from source, and copy the relevant files and Lua plugin files in the phase. Do note, however, that you still need to fetch the plugin sources somehow. npins is, once again, the recommended option to fetch the plugin sources. Refer to the previous section on how to use npins to add a new plugin. Plugins built from source must go into the overlay. It will automatically create flake outputs for individual packages. Lastly, you must add your package to the plugin builder ( ) function manually in . Once done, you may refer to your plugin as a string . Modular Setup Options {#sec-modular-setup-options} Most plugins is initialized with a call to . We use a special function that lets you easily add support for such setup options in a modular way: . Once you have added the source of the plugin as shown above, you can define the setup options like this: This above config will result in this Lua script: Now users can set any of the pre-defined option field, and can also add their own fields! Details of {#sec-details-of-toluaobject} As you've seen above, is used to convert our nix attrSet , into a lua table. Here are some rules of the conversion: Nix converts to lua Number and strings convert to their lua counterparts Nix attribute sets ( ) and lists ( ) convert into Lua dictionaries and tables respectively. Here is an example of Nix -> Lua conversion. -> -> You can write raw Lua code using . This function is part of nixpkgs, and is accessible without relying on nvf 's extended library. will yield the following result: The above expression will be interpreted as a Lua expression in the final config. Without the function, you will only receive a string literal. You can use it to feed plugin configuration tables Lua functions that return specific values as expected by the plugins. Lazy Loading Plugins {#sec-lazy-plugins} If the plugin can be lazy-loaded, should be used to add it. Lazy plugins are managed by . This results in the following lua code: A full list of options can be found in the spec on the rendered manual. Keybinds {#sec-keybinds} As of 0.4, there exists an API for writing your own keybinds and a couple of useful utility functions are available in the extended standard library . The following section contains a general overview to how you may utilize said functions. Custom Key Mappings Support for a Plugin {#sec-custom-key-mappings} To set a mapping, you should define it in . As an example, a simple keybinding can look like this: There are many other settings available in the keymap module. Please refer to the module option documentation for a full and up-to-date list of them. To make adding new keymaps for your favorite plugins easier, nvf provides a helper function.

In such a case you might want to configure your Neovim instance using Lua, and nothing but Lua. It is also possible to mix Lua and Nix configurations. Pure Lua or hybrid Lua/Nix configurations can be achieved in two different ways. Purely , by modifying Neovim's runtime directory or impurely by placing Lua configuration in a directory found in . For your convenience, this section will document both methods as they can be used. Pure Runtime Directory {#sec-pure-nvf-runtime} As of 0.6, nvf allows you to modify Neovim's runtime path to suit your needs. One of the ways the new runtime option is to add a configuration located relative to your , which must be version controlled in pure flakes manner. This will add the directory, or rather, the store path that will be realised after your flake gets copied to the Nix store, to Neovim's runtime directory. You may now create a directory within this nvim directory, and call it with {option} . Impure Absolute Directory {#sec-impure-absolute-dir} As of Neovim 0.9 , {var} is a variable expected by Neovim to decide on the configuration directory. nvf sets this variable as , meaning will be regarded as the configuration directory by Neovim, similar to how behaves in regular installations. This allows some degree of Lua configuration, backed by our low-level wrapper mnw . Creating a directory located in (\"nvf\" by default) and placing your configuration in, e.g., will allow you to it as a part of the Lua module system through nvf's module system. Let's assume your consists of the following: The following Nix configuration via {option} will allow loading this After you load your custom configuration, you may use an located in your custom configuration directory to configure Neovim exactly as you would without a wrapper like nvf.

Boasting flexibility, robustness and ease of use (among other positive traits), this project allows you to configure a fully featured Neovim instance with a few lines of Nix while leaving all kinds of doors open for integrating Lua in your configurations whether you are a beginner or an advanced user . Try it Out {#ch-try-it-out} Thanks to the portability of Nix, you can try out nvf without actually installing it to your machine. Below are the commands you may run to try out different configurations provided by this flake. As of v0.5, two specialized configurations are provided: Nix ( ) - Nix language server + simple utility plugins Maximal ( ) - Variable language servers + utility and decorative plugins You may try out any of the provided configurations using the command on a system where Nix is installed. Do keep in mind that this is susceptible to garbage collection meaning that the built outputs will be removed from your Nix store once you garbage collect. Using Prebuilt Configurations {#sec-using-prebuilt-configs} Available Configurations {#sec-available-configs} [!NOTE] The below configurations are provided for demonstration purposes, and are not designed to be installed as is. You may refer to the installation steps below and the helpful tips section for details on creating your own configurations. Nix {#sec-configs-nix} configuration by default provides LSP/diagnostic support for Nix alongside a set of visual and functional plugins. By running , which is the default package, you will build Neovim with this config. This command will start Neovim with some opinionated plugin configurations, and is designed specifically for Nix. The configuration lets you see how a fully configured Neovim setup might look like without downloading too many packages or shell utilities. Maximal {#sec-configs-maximal} is the ultimate configuration that will enable support for more commonly used language as well as additional complementary plugins. Keep in mind, however, that this will pull a lot of dependencies. It uses the same configuration template with the Nix configuration, but supports many more languages, and enables more utility, companion or fun plugins. [!WARNING] Running the maximal config will download a lot of packages as it is downloading language servers, formatters, and more. If CPU time and bandwidth are concerns, please use the default package instead. Installing nvf {#ch-installation} There are multiple ways of installing nvf on your system.
