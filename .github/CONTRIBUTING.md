## Preface

[LICENSE]: ../LICENSE

I am glad you are thinking about contributing to nvf! The project is shaped by
contributors and user feedback, and all contributions are appreciated.

If you are unsure about anything, whether a change is necessary or if it would
be accepted _had_ you created a PR, please just ask! Or submit the issue or pull
request anyway, the worst that can happen is that you will be politely asked to
change something. Friendly contributions are _always_ welcome.

Before you contribute, I encourage you to read the rest of this document for our
contributing policy and guidelines, followed by the [LICENSE] to understand how
your contributions are licensed.

If you have any questions regarding those files, or would like to ask a question
that is not covered by any of them, please feel free to open an issue!
Discussions tab is also available for less formal discussions. You may also
choose to contact me on Discord or Matrix if you would like to talk to me
personally.

## Contributing Process

[pull request template]: ./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md

The contribution process is mostly documented in the [pull request template].
When you create a pull request, you will find a checklist of items to complete
before it can be submitted. We ask that you please complete it before submitting
a pull request to help maintainers provide more specific feedback. If you are
unsure about any of the items, please ask.

### Guidelines

We provide instructions for a healthy contribution to nvf. This includes
**styling**, **commit formats**, **how-to guides for common contributions**. You
are strongly encouraged to read the contributing guidelines in full over at
[the documentation](https://notashelf.github.io/nvf#hacking).

A general gist of our requirements is that you must

1. Write clean Nix code
2. Self-test your changes
3. Document your changes

Though, please take a look at the manual for the complete contributing guide.
Please also feel free to let us know if you feel that something is missing. We
hope to provide clear, comprehensive instructions that make the contribution
process a breeze.

### Code of Conduct

This project does not have a formal code of conduct yet, and to be perfectly
honest I am not entirely positive if I want one or if it will _ever_ have one.
This project is not expected to be a hotbed of activity, and I trust my
contributors to keep it civil and respectful.

I do, however, want to make sure that everyone who does contribute feels welcome
and safe around project spaces. As such, I will do my best to make sure anyone
who disrupts the project or engages in negative behaviour will are dealt with
appropriately, and swiftly. You are invited to share any concerns that you have
with the projects moderation, be it over public or private spaces.

If you feel that you are not being treated with respect, please contact me
directly.
