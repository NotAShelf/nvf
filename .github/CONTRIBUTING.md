## Welcome

I'm glad you are thinking about contributing to neovim-flake! If you're unsure about anything, just ask - or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. Friendly contributions are always welcome.

Before you contribute, I encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

If you have any questions regarding those files, feel free to open an issue or [shoot me an email](mailto:me@notashelf.dev). Discussions tab is also available for more informal discussions.

## Contributing

The contribution process is mostly documented in the [pull request template](pull_request_template.md). You will find a checklist of items to complete before submitting a pull request. Please make sure you complete it before submitting a pull request. If you are unsure about any of the items, please ask.

### Guidelines

We provide instructions on a healthy contribution to neovim-flake - including styling, commit formats, how-to guides for adding new modules and options.
You are very well recommended to read the contributing guideliner over at [the documentation](https://notashelf.github.io/neovim-flake#hacking)

### Code of Conduct

This project does not quite have a code of conduct yet. And to be honest, I'm not sure if I want one or if it will ever have one. I'm not expecting this project to be a hotbed of activity, but I do want to make sure that everyone who does contribute feels welcome and safe. As such, I will do my best to make sure that those who distrupt the project are dealt with swiftly and appropriately.

If you feel that you are not being treated with respect, please contact me directly.
