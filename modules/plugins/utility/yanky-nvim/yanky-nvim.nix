          storage mode for ring values.

          - shada: this will save pesistantly using Neovim ShaDa feature.
            This means that history will be persisted between each session of Neovim.
          - memory: each Neovim instance will have his own history and it will be
            lost between sessions.
          - sqlite: more reliable than `shada`, requires `sqlite.lua` as a dependency.
            nvf will add this dependency to `PATH` automatically.
