            The register to be used by the Neovim clipboard. Recognized types are:

            * unnamed: Vim will use the clipboard register `"*"` for all yank, delete,
              change and put operations which would normally go to the unnamed register.

            * unnamedplus: A variant of the "unnamed" flag which uses the clipboard register
            `"+"` ({command}`:h quoteplus`) instead of register `"*"` for all yank, delete,
            change and put operations which would normally go to the unnamed register.

            When `unnamed` and `unnamedplus` is included simultaneously as `"unnamed,unnamedplus"`,
            yank and delete operations (but not put) will additionally copy the text into register `"*"`.

            Please see  {command}`:h clipboard` for more details.
