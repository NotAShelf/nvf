# Custom Plugins {#ch-custom-plugins}

**nvf**, by default, exposes a wide variety of plugins as module options
for your convenience and bundles necessary dependencies into **nvf**'s runtime.
In case a plugin is not available in **nvf**, you may consider making a pull
request to **nvf** to include it as a module or you may add it to your
configuration locally.

## Adding Plugins {#ch-adding-plugins}

There are multiple ways of adding custom plugins to your **nvf** configuration.

You can use custom plugins, before they are implemented in the flake. To add a
plugin to the runtime, you need to add it to the `vim.startPlugins` list in
your configuration.

Adding a plugin to `startPlugins` will not allow you to configure the plugin
that you have adeed, but **nvf** provides multiple way of configuring any
custom plugins that you might have added to your configuration.
