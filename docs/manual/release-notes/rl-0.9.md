# Release 0.9 {#sec-release-0-9}

## Breaking changes

- Nixpkgs has merged a fully incompatible rewrite of
  `vimPlugins.nvim-treesitter`. Namely, it changes from the frozen `master`
  branch to the new main branch. This change removes incremental selections, so
  it is no longer available.
- [obsidian.nvim] now uses a maintained fork which has removed the `dir`
  setting. Use `workspaces` instead:

  ```nix
  {
    workspaces = [
      {
        name = "any-string";
        path = "~/old/dir/path/value";
      }
    ];
  }
  ```

  Some other settings and commands are now deprecated but are still supported.

  - The `setupOpts.mappings` options were also removed. Use the built-in Neovim
    settings (nvf's {option}`vim.keymaps`)

## Changelog {#sec-release-0-9-changelog}

[taylrfnt](https://github.com/taylrfnt)

- Introduce a `darwinModule` option for Darwin users. The ergonomics of
  importing a `nixosModule` into a Darwin flake were less than ideal, and when
  users fork and update npins, they are prone to encountering errors like the
  following:

  ```shell
  (class: "nixos") cannot be imported into a module 
  evaluation that expects class "darwin".
  ```

[suimong](https://github.com/suimong):

- Fix `vim.tabline.nvimBufferline` where `setupOpts.options.hover` requires
  `vim.opt.mousemoveevent` to be set.

[thamenato](https://github.com/thamenato):

- Attempt to adapt nvim-treesitter to (breaking) Nixpkgs changes. Some
  treesitter grammars were changed to prefer `grammarPlugins` over
  `builtGrammars`.

[jfeo](https://github.com/jfeo):

[ccc.nvim]: https://github.com/uga-rosa/ccc.nvim

- Added [ccc.nvim] option {option}`vim.utility.ccc.setupOpts` with the existing
  hard-coded options as default values.

[Ring-A-Ding-Ding-Baby](https://github.com/Ring-A-Ding-Ding-Baby):

- Aligned `codelldb` adapter setup with [rustaceanvim]’s built-in logic.
- Added `languages.rust.dap.backend` option to choose between `codelldb` and
  `lldb-dap` adapters.

[Libadoxon](https://github.com/Libadoxon):

- `toggleterm` open map now also works when in terminal mode

[jtliang24](https://github.com/jtliang24):

- Updated nix language plugin to use pkgs.nixfmt instead of
  pkgs.nixfmt-rfc-style

- Upgrade [obsidian.nvim] to use a maintained fork, instead of the unmaintained
  upstream.
  - Various upstream improvements:
    - Support [blink.cmp] and completion plugin autodetection.
    - Support various pickers for prompts, including [snacks.nvim]'s
      `snacks.picker`, [mini.nvim]'s `mini.pick`, [telescope.nvim], and
      [fzf-lua].
    - Merge commands like `ObsidianBacklinks` into `Obisidian backlinks`. The
      old format is still supported by default.
    - Some `setupOpts` options have changed:
      - `disable_frontmatter` -> `frontmatter.enabled` (and inverted), still
        supported.
      - `note_frontmatter_func` -> `frontmatter.func`, still supported.
      - `statusline` module is now deprecated in favour of `footer`, still
        supported.
      - `dir` is no longer supported, use `workspaces`:

        ```nix
        {
          workspaces = [
            {
              name = "any-string";
              path = "~/old/dir/path/value";
            }
          ];
        }
        ```

      - `use_advanced_uri` -> `open.use_advanced_uri`.
      - Mappings are now expected to be set using the built-in Neovim APIs,
        managed by `vim.keymaps` in nvf, instead of `mappings` options.
      - Some option defaults have changed.
    - And more.
  - Automatically configure an enabled picker in the order mentioned above, if
    any are enabled.
  - Add integration with `snacks.image` for rendering workspace/vault assets.
  - Detect if [render-markdown.nvim] or [markview.nvim] are enabled and disable
    the `ui` module if so. It should work without this, but `render-markdown`'s
    {command}`:healthcheck` doesn't know that.
  - Remove [which-key.nvim] `<leader>o` `+Notes` description which did not
    actually correspond to any keybinds.

[pyrox0](https://github.com/pyrox0):

- Added [rumdl](https://github.com/rvben/rumdl) support to `languages.markdown`

- Added [sqruff](https://github.com/quarylabs/sqruff) support to `languages.sql`

- Added [Pyrefly](https://pyrefly.org/) support to `languages.python`

- Added TOML support via {option}`languages.toml` and the
  [Tombi](https://tombi-toml.github.io/tombi/) language server, linter, and
  formatter.

- Added [hlargs.nvim](https://github.com/m-demare/hlargs.nvim) support as
  `visuals.hlargs-nvim`.

[Machshev](https://github.com/machshev):

- Added `ruff` and `ty` LSP support for Python under `programs.python`.
