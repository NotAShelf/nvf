# nvf Configuration Options {#ch-options}

Below are the module options provided by nvf, in no particular order. Most
options will include useful comments, warnings or setup tips on how a module
option is meant to be used as well as examples in complex cases.

An offline version of this page is bundled with nvf as a part of the manpages
which you can access with `man 5 nvf`. Please us know if you believe any of the
options below are missing useful examples.

<!--
In the manual, individual options may be referenced in Hyperlinks as follows:
[](#opt-vim.*) If changing the prefix here, do keep in mind the #opt- suffix will have
to be changed everywhere.
